# Talk Simulator

Have you ever felt like you weren’t smart enough to ask the right question to an LLM about a topic you’re interested in? Let’s change that approach: instead, let’s have smart LLMs talk to each other about your topics.

### How it works

You create 3 prompts:
- A shared system prompt that defines the topics and goals you want to explore
- Two role prompts that define the perspectives or roles of the two LLMs participating in the discussion

Then, you simply watch as the two models unpack your topics and questions.
