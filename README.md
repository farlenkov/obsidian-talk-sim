# Talk Simulator

Have you ever felt like you weren’t smart enough to ask the right question to an LLM about a topic you’re interested in? Let’s change that approach: instead, let’s have smart LLMs talk to each other about your topics.

### How it works

You create 3 prompts:
- A shared system prompt that defines the topics and goals you want to explore
- Two role prompts that define the perspectives or roles of the two LLMs participating in the discussion

Then, you simply watch as the two models unpack your topics and questions.

## Installation

1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/farlenkov/obsidian-talk-sim/releases/latest) (files `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json`).
2. Copy this files to your Obsidian plugins directory: `vault/.obsidian/plugins/talk-sim`.
3. Enable the plugin in `Obsidian` → `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Talk Sim`.
